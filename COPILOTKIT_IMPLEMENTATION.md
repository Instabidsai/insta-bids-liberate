# CopilotKit Generative UI Implementation

## 🚀 Live Demo: [instabids.ai/agents-made-easy](https://instabids.ai/agents-made-easy)

This demonstrates the power of CopilotKit's generative UI capabilities integrated with your real sales bot API.

## ✨ Features

### Dynamic UI Generation
Instead of just text responses, the AI generates interactive components:

- **Pricing Tables** - Appear when discussing costs or plans
- **Booking Calendar** - Shows up for demo scheduling
- **Progress Indicators** - Display implementation timelines
- **ROI Calculator** - Dynamic financial projections

### Real Agent Integration
- Connected to your production sales bot at `https://instabids-sales-bot-api-67gkc.ondigitalocean.app`
- No demo data - this uses your actual agent
- Pattern matching triggers appropriate UI components

## 🧪 Test It Out

Try these prompts to see the generative UI in action:

1. **"Show me your pricing plans"** - Generates an interactive pricing table
2. **"I want to book a demo"** - Creates a calendar booking interface
3. **"What's the implementation timeline?"** - Shows a progress indicator
4. **"Calculate ROI for my business"** - Displays an ROI calculator

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
"@copilotkit/react-core": "^1.3.15",
"@copilotkit/react-ui": "^1.3.15",
"framer-motion": "^11.2.10"
```

### Key Files Modified
1. **`src/pages/tools/AgentsMadeEasy.tsx`** - Main component with CopilotKit integration
2. **`vite.config.ts`** - Proxy configuration for API requests
3. **`package.json`** - Added required dependencies

### Architecture
- Uses CopilotKit's `useCopilotAction` hook for UI generation
- Vite proxy forwards `/api/copilot/agents-made-easy` to your sales bot
- Pattern matching in responses triggers appropriate UI components

## 🔄 Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Visit http://localhost:8080/agents-made-easy

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

This isn't just a chatbot - it's a **living interface** that morphs based on the conversation:

- The AI doesn't just describe pricing, it **shows** an interactive pricing table
- It doesn't just mention booking, it **creates** a calendar interface
- Every interaction generates the optimal UI for that moment

## 🚀 Deployment

The app automatically deploys to Vercel on push to main branch.

## 📝 Notes

- The proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts` handles the transformation from your agent's response format to CopilotKit's expected format
- Pattern matching is currently done in the proxy layer but could be moved to a dedicated backend service for more complex scenarios
- This is a production-ready implementation with error handling and responsive design
