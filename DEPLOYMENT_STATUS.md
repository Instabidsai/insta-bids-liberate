# CopilotKit Agents Made Easy - Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Code is in: `github.com/Instabidsai/insta-bids-liberate`
   - Deployed to: `https://www.instabids.ai`
   - Main page route: `/agents-made-easy`

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Location: `/src/pages/tools/AgentsMadeEasy.tsx`
   - Features:
     - CopilotKit integration with chat UI
     - Dynamic component generation (pricing, calendar, progress, ROI)
     - Action handlers for UI triggers
     - Framer Motion animations

3. **API Implementation**
   - Location: `/api/agents-made-easy.js`
   - Type: Node.js serverless function
   - Features:
     - Proxies requests to your Claude sales bot
     - Enhances responses with UI trigger phrases
     - Returns OpenAI-compatible format for CopilotKit

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive guide at `/docs/agents-made-easy.md`
   - Updated `.env.example` with required variables

## ‚ùå Current Issues

1. **API Function Not Working**
   - Getting `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` errors
   - Vercel is not properly executing the serverless functions
   - Possible causes:
     - Node.js version mismatch
     - Missing dependencies in production
     - Vercel configuration issues

2. **Missing Environment Variable**
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` needs to be added to Vercel
   - Without it, CopilotKit runtime won't work properly

## üîß What You Need to Do

### 1. Add Environment Variable in Vercel
```
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your "insta-bids-liberate" project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add: OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key
5. Click Save and redeploy
```

### 2. Check Vercel Function Logs
```
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to Functions tab
2. Look for error logs for agents-made-easy
3. Check what's causing the invocation failure
```

### 3. Possible Fixes to Try

**Option A: Use Vercel CLI for Better Debugging**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev  # Test locally with Vercel environment
```

**Option B: Simplify to Edge Functions**
The Edge runtime might work better. We have an Edge version saved as `agents-made-easy-edge.js`.

**Option C: Use a Different Approach**
Instead of serverless functions, use Next.js API routes or a separate backend service.

## üìù Testing Instructions

Once the API is working:

1. Visit: https://www.instabids.ai/agents-made-easy
2. Try these prompts:
   - "What are your pricing plans?"
   - "I want to book a demo"
   - "Show me the implementation process"
   - "Calculate ROI for my business"

## üöÄ When It Works

You'll see:
- Chat interface on the right
- Dynamic UI components appearing on the left
- Smooth animations as components render
- Real responses from your Claude sales bot

## üìû Support

If you need help:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Test with local development first (`npm run dev`)
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Try the simple test endpoint: `/api/simple`

## üéØ Next Steps

Once the basic functionality works:
1. Add more UI component types
2. Implement user interaction tracking
3. Create A/B testing variations
4. Add analytics integration
5. Build more agent interfaces

The frontend is ready and waiting - we just need to fix the serverless function deployment issue!
